# app
its a server that i have hosted on heroku at:https://vocablang.herokuapp.com/
it running a fetch command for a discord bot which i have designed which u can join at :https://discord.gg/CP3z4Q6V
this bot basically tells you about covid vaccine sloys available near you.


to know about slots you have to type in chat in this format '$vs 123456 20-06-2021'
here 12345-is your pin code && 20-06-2021 -is date for which you want to find slots.
CURRENTLY SINCE MY SERVER IS HOSTED IN UNITED STATES REGION THE OPEN API FOR CO-WIN DOESNOT ALLOW ACCESS TO MY FETCH COMMAND-SO FEATURE MAY NOT BE WORKING CORRECTLY
IF YOU ARE NEDRY ENOUGH JUST CLONE THIS REPO AND IN CMD RUN THE COMMAND 'npm install'followed by 'node index.js'..then my bot be accssed though your local machine and you'll be able
to run discord command effectively
thank you:)
